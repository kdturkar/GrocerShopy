# GrocerShopy
The objective is to develop and implement a fully functional 'GrocerShopy' module which will allow customers to register, browse and purchase through all the available products. They can add products to cart and order them. It will also have an admin panel to manage options like add and update details of products. Admin can see the orders, all the customer list and can also manage customers.                                                                         
It is a 3-Tier web-based application where for Presentation Tier we have used ReactJs, for Application Server Tier Spring Boot, and for Database Server Tier MySQL.
